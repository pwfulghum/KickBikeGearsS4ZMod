KickBikeGearsS4ZMod
========
An implementation of a mod for Sauce for Zwift that will provide Wahoo Kickr Bike Gear information 
to Sauce for Zwift.

At this time (Jan 19, 2024), you must be running version 1.0.11-alpha (or later) version of Sauce for Zwift 
for this mod to work.

You will also need THIS for the actual data to be injected into Sauce 4 Zwift.
This mod simply lets you see the data once it is there.

Basics
--------
A Sauce for Zwift "Mod" is a directory placed in `~/Documents/SauceMods`.  NOTE: "Documents"
may be called "My Documents" on some platforms.  For first time mod users they should create
an empty **SauceMods** folder first.  Then each Mod will be a sub directory in there such as...
```
Documents
└── SauceMods
    ├── KickBikeGearsS4ZMod
    └── super_duper_theme_mod
```

To install this mod, just place in the directory structure as shown above and restart 
Sauce For Zwift.    You will now see new data type available when you add data to a window.
